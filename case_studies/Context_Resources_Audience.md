## Background

XYZ company is an online retailer that sells clothing through its web site. One persistent problem that they have is losing potential customers during the checkout process (and thus losing sales). The company hypothesized that the checkout process took too long and was potentially confusing. They decided they needed to develop a simpler version of the process.  

To address this problem with the checkout process the team in charge of this part of the web site designed a modification to make it faster and decided to A/B test it to compare it to the current approach. Visitors to the web site were randomly chosen to use the current approach or the new approach and the logging system tracked whether or not a checkout was completed or not (i.e. a sale occurred). After a week, the new process was taken off-line and the data from the A/B test were taken for analysis. 

The team is eager to know if their new process is an improvement over the current version.


## Initial Questions

The goal of the initial stages of analysis is to develop a rough sketch of what your solution might look like. As the person leading this analysis, you have the opportunity to ask the members of the checkout team at XYZ questions about the data and the experiment. Assume for now that you were not part of the initial development of the checkout process or the execution of the A/B test.

* Write down **three questions** that come to mind that you would want to ask in order to get a better sense of what kind of analysis XYZ needs for this problem. 

* Label each question with a **1**, **2**, or **3**, indicating your first-most important, second-most important, and third-most important question.

* Consider if there are any questions whose answer might determine whether the analysis is possible at all.
